Teacher Feedback

1. My contact and Home pages use the same color contrast for the background (being a light gray) while my portfolio and about me pages use different ones, so make my contact page different.

2. He wishes the site had a bit more "pinache", can i make the site "fun? Especially in a site about myself.

Changes implemented:

1. Adjusted the HTML background in the css used for the contact page to a different shade of gray (#e0e0e0). 
2. Added a accent border and a box shader to the cards used for the content on the home page.
