                <h1>My Early Life</h1>
                <p>
                    I was born on June 5th, 2001 at the Naval Hospital in Bremerton, WA. I was kind of a awkward kid growing up. 
                    I didn't have a ton of friends but I always tried to get along with others.

                <h1>Work Experience</h1>
                <p>
                    I got my first job in the late spring of 2024, working as a government contractor for the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard
                    as a provision loader. I load food onto Naval vessels.

                <h1>Game Development Experience</h1>
                <p>
                    I originally went to the Academy of Interactive Entertainment in Seattle, WA from 2020-2022 to study Game Design and 
                    Production, it is there where I proceeded to get my experience developing video games. As a result of going there and 
                    working in my free time, I have gained experience working in the game engines Godot, Unity, and Unreal Engine. 
                    Game Development is my life-long passion alongside being a programmer and I really hope at some point in my life that
                    it's what I can do as a living.
