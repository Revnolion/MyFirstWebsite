                <p>
                    I was born in 2001 in Bremerton, WA. My first computer, an old Windows XP laptop, sparked a lifelong
                    curiosity for technology and deep technical tinkering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That curiosity led to my first custom-built desktop (GTX 960 and i7-930). I've since upgraded that
                    machine many times over, eventually building the high-end desktop I use today. This decade-long
                    process taught me valuable lessons in systems architecture and relentless problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hands-on, persistent approach to hardware directly translates to my work in software
                    development: I enjoy building robust, efficient systems from the ground up.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Column">
                <h2><i class="fas fa-anchor" style="color: #04AA6d; margin-right: 10px;"></i>Real-World Discipline</h2>
                <p>
                    Since Late Spring 2024, I've worked as a provision loader for the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.
                    Loading food onto naval vessels is a demanding job focused on logistics and reliability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though non-technical, this experience has been invaluable in forging core professional traits:
                    unwavering reliability, meticulous planning, and the ability to perform under high pressure. These
                    skills ensure I maintain clean version control, adhere to production schedules, and function as a
                    dependable member of any development team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also co-founded an indie game studio with a fellow alum from my last school. While our projects
                    are still in the planning stages, this venture is developing my skills in project scoping and
                    collaborative direction.

                    Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    I gained my formal foundation at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment in Seattle, WA
                    (2020-2022), focusing on Game Design and Production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My primary expertise is in systems and gameplay programming using Godot, GDScript, and Unreal Engine
                    5 (Blueprints). I am passionate about creating reusable, efficient engine tools and solving complex
                    gameplay logic challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Game development is my life-long passion. I am actively seeking a role as a Gameplay Programmer,
                    Game Designer or Tools Developer where I can combine my technical skills and disciplined approach to
                    build engaging experiences.
