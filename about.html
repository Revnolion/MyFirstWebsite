            <h2>My Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                I was born on June 5th, 2001 at the Naval Hospital in Bremerton, WA. I was kind of an awkward kid
                growing up.
                I didn't have a ton of friends but I always tried to get along with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                My very first computer was an old laptop running Windows XP. Then in 2015 I got my very first desktop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The custom built desktop was equipped with a Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 and a i7-930 CPU, I would go on to
                continue to
                upgrade this PC multiple times over an entire decade, eventually getting to the point that my PC is at
                today...
                equipped with a Nvidia Geforce RTX 4070 SUPER and a AMD Ryzen 7 7800x3D CPU.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I got my first job in Late Spring 2024 as a government contractor for the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard
                as a provision loader. I load food onto naval vessels. It can be a tough job, but I enjoy doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also started up an indie video game studio with a fellow alumni from my last school, we don't have any
                projects yet,
                but we're hoping to have something within the next few years!

            <h2>Game Development Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I originally went to the Academy of Interactive Entertainment in Seattle, WA from 2020-2022 to study
                Game Design and
                Production, it is there where I proceeded to get my experience developing video games.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of going there and working in my free time, I have gained experience working in the game
                engines Godot, Unity, and Unreal Engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Game Development is my life-long passion alongside being a programmer and I really hope at some point in
                my life that
                it's what I can do as a living.
