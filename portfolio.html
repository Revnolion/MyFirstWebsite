            <h1>Darkness of Anima</h1>
            <p>
                Darkness of Anima was the final project I worked on as part of my studies at the Academy of Interactive
                Entertainment in Seattle, WA. This project is a turn-based RPG and was the culmination of 4 months of hard work with 9 people in the 
                Unity game engine. I served as director and as one of the 3 game designers on the project. Some of my 
                responsibilites included working on level design layouts, building the environments in-engine as we got assets
                from the artists, and I directed the team during production, taking suggestions and feedback from fellow peers
                in development to further improve the game. 

                We got the game to a finished prototype state and released it at the end of the school year publicly on the 
                indie game service itch.io.

            <h1>Living Nightmare</h1>
            <p>
                Living Nightmare was the final project of my first year at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment in Seattle, WA.
                This project is a puzzle-horror game and was the result of 2 months of work with 9 people in the Unity engine. I served as the lead game designer
                on the project. Some of my responsibilites included working on level design layouts, building environments, and 
                assisting my designer peers throughout production. 

                We got the game to a finished prototype state and released it at the end of that school year publicly on the 
                indie game service itch.io.

            <h1>Particle Paint</h1>
            <p>
                Particle Paint is a small project I've been working on in my free time in Unreal Engine 5. It is a small painting game/software 
                that utilizes Unreal Engine's particle systems to allow you to draw/paint using particle effects. I have currently developed
                systems that allows multiple brushes, brush sensitivity (so the particles are bigger depending on mouse stroke), export to
                a PNG image, and more. I currently have multiple major updates in the works as well. This project will be released to the public
                in the near future.
