        <p> <!-- The main text explaining the project. -->
          Particle Paint is a personal project developed in Unreal Engine 5 that functions as a small painting
          application utilizing the engine's native particle systems to create dynamic visual effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          My core contribution was developing several robust systems, including multiple custom brushes, brush
          sensitivity controls (tied to mouse input for dynamic sizing), and a final tool for exporting the canvas to a
          PNG image.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently have multiple major updates planned, with a goal to release the project publicly in the near
          future.

        <h1>Little Nightmares-Style Camera (Godot Engine Plugin)</h1>
        <h2><strong>Project Completion:</strong> November 2025</h2>
        <!--Used strong tags for these to emphasize the text before the :-->
        <h2><strong>Engine:</strong> Godot</h2>
        <h2><strong>Programming Language:</strong> GDScript</h2>

            Camera Plugin</a> </h2>
        <!-- Uses target="_blank" to open in a new tab and rel="noopener noreferrer" for security. -->
        <p> <!-- The main text explaining the project. -->
          This is a reusable plugin developed in GDScript for the Godot Engine. I engineered and implemented this
          system
          to address a complex level design challenge by replicating the confined,
          cinematic camera perspective seen in games like Little Nightmares.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core system seamlessly blends 2D-style character movement with complex 3D camera constraints. My work
          focused heavily on integrating advanced camera logic with the Godot editor,
          utilizing a spline-based rail system that meticulously controls the camera's fixed position, rotation, and
          focus points.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resulting tool is robust, reusable, and designed for easy implementation across new projects. While
          initially intended only for private use, I decided to release the tool publicly! The tool can be downloaded
          from Github using the link above!

        <h1>Darkness of Anima</h1>
        <h2><strong>Project Release:</strong> July 2022</h2>
        <h2><strong>Engine:</strong> Unity</h2>
        <h2><strong>Project Link:</strong> <a href="https://aieseattle.itch.io/darkness-of-anima" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"> Darkness of Anima</a></h2>
        <!-- Uses target="_blank" to open in a new tab and rel="noopener noreferrer" for security. -->
        <p> <!-- The main text explaining the project. -->
          Darkness of Anima was the final project I worked on as part of my studies at the Academy of Interactive
          Entertainment in Seattle, WA.
          This project is a turn-based RPG and was the culmination of 4 months of hard work with 9 people in the Unity
          engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I served as Director and Lead Designer on the project. My primary responsibilities centered on
          environmental narrative and level design: I crafted the level layouts and built the dark, atmospheric
          environments in-engine, using assets to communicate the game's lore and story without relying solely on
          dialogue.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Director, I oversaw the project's production pipeline, ensuring the artistic vision and design goals
          remained cohesive across all disciplines (Art, Design, and Programming). The game achieved a finished
          prototype state and was released publicly on the indie game service itch.io.
        </p>

        <h1>Living Nightmare</h1>
        <h2><strong>Project Release:</strong> July 2021</h2>
        <h2><strong>Engine:</strong> Unity</h2>
        <h2><strong>Project Link:</strong> <a href="https://aieseattle.itch.io/living-nightmare" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"> Living Nightmare</a></h2>
        <!-- Uses target="_blank" to open in a new tab and rel="noopener noreferrer" for security. -->
        <p> <!-- The main text explaining the project. -->
          Living Nightmare was the final project of my first year at AIE Seattle. This project is a puzzle-horror game
          developed over two months with a team of nine in the Unity engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I served as the Lead Game Designer. My responsibilities included creating level design layouts, building
          environments in-engine, and directing design workflow while assisting my peers throughout production.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game achieved a finished prototype state and was released publicly on itch.io at the conclusion of the
          school year.
